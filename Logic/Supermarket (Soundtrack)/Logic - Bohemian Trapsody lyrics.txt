[Pre-Chorus] 
	 Every night 
	 I grab a little piece of earth and make it ignite 
	 I'm a satellite 
	 Drifting through your nova at the speed of light 
	 Every night 
	 I grab a little piece of earth and make it ignite 
	 I’m a satellite 
	 Drifting through your nova at the speed of light 
	 I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know 
	 I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know 
	 Yes, I said, yes, I said, yes, I said, yes, I should know, oh 
	 
	 [Chorus] 
	 And when I fall for you 
	 That's when I'll break down my wall for you 
	 Promise that I’d risk it all for you 
	 Promise to reveal my all for you 
	 That's when I fall for you 
	 That's when I'll break down my wall for you 
	 Promise that I'd risk it all for you 
	 Promise to reveal my all for you 
	 
	 [Break] 
	 Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
	 Na-na-na-na (Hey) 
	 Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
	 Na-na-na-na (Yeah) 
	 
	 [Pre-Chorus] 
	 Every night

	 I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know 
	 I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know 
	 Yes, I said, yes, I said, yes, I said, yes, I should know, oh 
	 
	 [Chorus] 
	 And when I fall for you 
	 That's when I break down my wall for you 
	 Promise that I'd risk it all for you 
	 Promise to reveal my all for you 
	 And when I fall for you 
	 That’s when I break down my wall for you 
	 Promise that I’d risk it all for you 
	 Promise to reveal my all for you
