[Verse] 
	 Hey there, are you listenin'? 
	 I just found a dead man by the bridge again 
	 By the bridge again 
	 Spread your wings and take the leap 
	 Spill your blood all on the street by the bridge again 
	 By the bridge again 
	 Why isn't anybody listening 
	 This world is so beautiful, but then again 
	 But then again 
	 
	 [Chorus] 
	 It feels like everywhere I go 
	 I'm searching for something inside my soul 
	 If I never find what I'm searching for 
	 Would you still love me or let me go? 
	 It feels like everywhere I go 
	 I'm searching for something inside my soul 
	 If I never find what I'm searching for 
	 Would you still love me or let me go?
