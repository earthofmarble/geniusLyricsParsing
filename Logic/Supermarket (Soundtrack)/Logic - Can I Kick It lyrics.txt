[Intro: Juto] 
	 Okay 
	 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
	 
	 [Chorus: Juto] 
	 Wonderful beauty queen 
	 You're the only one for me 
	 It don't matter how it seems 
	 But you can come kick it with me 
	 Well, can I ask you, baby 
	 
	 [Refrain: Juto] 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) 
	 Well, I'm gone, gone 
	 
	 [Verse: Logic] 
	 Ayy, it's the Bobby Boy, better known as chocolate and vanilla 
	 Ain't another iller, I'm the nuke to Godzilla 
	 I feel a sensation, vibration comin' on 
	 Walk up in the spot like a motherfuckin' don 
	 What's up with you, shorty? Tryna get to know you 
	 I know we went to school together, that's the old you 
	 Never told you how I felt, I feel I owed you 
	 Never really tried to talk to you because of old dude 
	 But beautiful, beautiful, beautiful girl 
	 Don't you walk out my world 
	 Everything that the boy feel for you, girl 
	 It compiles my world 
	 
	 [Bridge: Logic] 
	 Tell me that you're satisfied 
	 Without me right by your side 
	 No, no, please don't run and hide 
	 Let your man give you a ride 
	 No, no, please don't run and hide 
	 Skippity, bop, bop, na, na, na, na 
	 La da-da-da, la da-da-da, da da da da 
	 
	 [Refrain: Logic] 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) (Na na na, na na, na na) 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) 
	 Well, I'm gone (Can I kick it?) (Gone and) 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) 
	 Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!) 
	 Well, I'm gone (Gone and) 
	 
	 [Chorus: Juto] 
	 Wonderful beauty queen 
	 You're the only one for me 
	 It don't matter how it seems 
	 But you can come kick it with me 
	 Well, can I ask you, baby
