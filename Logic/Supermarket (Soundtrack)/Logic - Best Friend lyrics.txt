[Chorus] 
	 You're my best friend, you’re the air that I breathe 
	 You're the love of my life, the only thing I'll ever need 
	 You’re the reason I wrote this song 
	 You're the one that I've been searching for 
	 Who's been right there all along 
	 
	 [Post-Chorus] 
	 My heart is heavier 
	 Been a thousand suns without you 
	 My heart is heavier 
	 Been a thousand suns without you 
	 
	 [Chorus] 
	 You're my best friend, you're the air that I breathe 
	 You're the love of my life, the only thing I'll ever need 
	 You’re the reason I wrote this song 
	 You’re the one that I've been searching for 
	 Who’s been right there all along 
	 
	 [Post-Chorus] 
	 My heart is heavier 
	 Been a thousand suns without you 
	 My heart is heavier 
	 Been a thousand suns without you
