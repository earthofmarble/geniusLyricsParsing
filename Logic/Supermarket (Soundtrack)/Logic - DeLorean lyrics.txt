[Verse 1] 
	 "Hey boy, this could be your life" 
	 I said, "Hey girl, you could be my wife" 
	 I said, "Hey man, don't take this shit too far" 
	 I said, "Woman, take a step inside my car" 
	 
	 [Chorus] 
	 Could only imagine the things that can happen 
	 But you let go and ran away 
	 Only imagine the things that can happen 
	 My only comparison is night and day 
	 Only imagine the things that can happen 
	 But you let go and ran away 
	 Only imagine the things that can happen 
	 My only comparison is night and, night and, night and day 
	 (Woo, woo) 
	 
	 [Verse 2] 
	 Take a trip inside of my DeLorean 
	 Back to the future where everyone's been dead for a long, long time 
	 Oh, the past, the past, the past, past, past 
	 We already know what happens when it happens 
	 
	 [Chorus] 
	 Could only imagine the things that can happen 
	 But you let go and ran away 
	 Only imagine the things that can happen 
	 My only comparison is night and day 
	 Only imagine the things that can happen 
	 But you let go and ran away 
	 Only imagine the things that can happen 
	 My only comparison is night and, night and, night and day 
	 (Woo, woo)
